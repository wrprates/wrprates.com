Who works with data analysis and want to share content face some limitations from the traditional tools to build website. One of the main reasons is the difficulty to share the results of chunks of code without needing to copy and paste images.

For example, if you are a data scientist and use Python or R to build interactive charts and tables in your work, it might be difficult to be able to publish this kind of result on a website using the traditional platforms.

There already many available solutions that facilitate this job. But here I want to call the attention to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## What is Quarto?

Quarto is a great reporting tool, which is supported by RStudio. Its own definition is:

> QuartoÂ® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

In Quarto you can "create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable".

## Basic workflow for a Quarto website with automated deployment

After taking a look to Quarto documentation and watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cLbh-k2qKk) (Pt) about automated deployment with Github Actions, I realized that it could be easier than I thought to set up a personal blog with the requirements that I had for this purpose using this tool.

So, the workflow I built using Quarto had as a result this website, and works like described below:

1. **Write** a post or build a static page (locally).
2. **Render** the website (locally).
3. **Push** it to Git.
4. After a merge in certain branch, **automate the deployment** process (upload the files via FTP).

## Steps to create an automated Quarto website

Quarto documentation is great. Basically all you need to know how to create a website with Quarto is to read [this session](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) in their website.

### Step 1. Download and install Quarto

If you don't have Quarto installed yet you can follow the steps [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

### Step 2. Build a Quarto website or blog

After have installed Quarto, it is needed to run on terminal the following code to create a Quarto website:

```
quarto create-project mysite --type website
```

If your website will be a *blog*, so you may prefer to use the following code:

```
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

This code will create a basic folder structure with the main files needed to start customizing your website.

### Step 3. Create a repo on Github

To be able to benefit from Github Actions, which we will use to automate the publishing workflow, you will need
to create a Github repository.

In this post I expected the reader to have at least minimum experience with Git (create repositories, understand how branches work, `git push`, `git pull`.)

You could have created the repository in the very first moment, but you can also 

### Step 4. Setup Github Actions

<!-- - I write a post in a Quarto file (`.qmd`) using Markdown syntax. I can add code chunks to the post and show the results (with interactivity, depending on the libraries used). It is similar with what we have for Jupyter notebooks (but with more possibilities), and basically the same we have for RMarkdown documents. -->

<!-- Yesterday after my work I was doing an interesting thing (at least for me:sweat_smile:). Some years ago I had a blog (using wordpress), then for some reasons I decided to move the content of this blog to another website. But I was always with the idea of reactivating a personal blog (not using wordpress). Then, yesterday I created a repo from the Quarto (R package for publishing) website template and I setup the repo with GitHub actions, in a way that every time you push on main branch it will "deploy the website" (upload the files to the host via ftp). As I am not so used with Github actions, making it work was awesome! -->
