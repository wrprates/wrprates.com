    "text": "Who works with data analysis and want to share content face some limitations from the traditional tools to build website. One of the main reasons is the difficulty to share the results of chunks of code without needing to copy and paste images.\nFor example, if you are a data scientist and use Python or R to build interactive charts and tables in your work, it might be difficult to be able to publish this kind of result on a website using the traditional platforms.\nThere already many available solutions that facilitate this job. But here I want to call the attention to Quarto."

    "text": "Steps to create an automated Quarto website\nQuarto documentation is great. Basically all you need to know how to create a website with Quarto is to read this session in their website.\n\nStep 1. Download and install Quarto\nIf you don’t have Quarto installed yet you can follow the steps here.\n\n\nStep 2. Build a Quarto website or blog\nAfter have installed Quarto, it is needed to run on terminal the following code to create a Quarto website:\nquarto create-project mysite --type website\nIf your website will be a blog, so you may prefer to use the following code:\nquarto create-project myblog --type website:blog\nThis code will create a basic folder structure with the main files needed to start customizing your website.\n\n\nStep 3. Create a repo on Github\nTo be able to benefit from Github Actions, which we will use to automate the publishing workflow, you will need to create a Github repository.\nIn this post I expected the reader to have at least minimum experience with Git (create repositories, understand how branches work, git push, git pull.)\nYou could have created the repository in the very first moment, but you can also\n\n\nStep 4. Setup Github Actions\n\nI write a post in a Quarto file (.qmd) using Markdown syntax. I can add code chunks to the post and show the results (with interactivity, depending on the libraries used). It is similar with what we have for Jupyter notebooks (but with more possibilities), and basically the same we have for RMarkdown documents.\n\nYesterday after my work I was doing an interesting thing (at least for me:sweat_smile:). Some years ago I had a blog (using wordpress), then for some reasons I decided to move the content of this blog to another website. But I was always with the idea of reactivating a personal blog (not using wordpress). Then, yesterday I created a repo from the Quarto (R package for publishing) website template and I setup the repo with GitHub actions, in a way that every time you push on main branch it will “deploy the website” (upload the files to the host via ftp). As I am not so used with Github actions, making it work was awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
